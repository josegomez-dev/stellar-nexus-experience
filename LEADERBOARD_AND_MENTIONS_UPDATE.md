## üîß Technical Implementation

### User Search Query
```typescript
// In game-social-service.ts
async searchUsers(searchQuery: string, maxResults: number = 10) {
  // Searches accounts collection
  // Filters by username, displayName, walletAddress
  // Returns user details: id, username, displayName, level, points
}
```

### Challenge Creation with Target User
```typescript
await gameSocialService.createChallenge(
  gameId,
  challengerId,
  challengerName,
  description,
  requirement,
  pointsReward,
  timeLimit,
  targetUserId,      // ‚úÖ Set from @ mention
  targetUsername,    // ‚úÖ Set from @ mention
  requiredScore
);
```

### Notification Integration (Ready)
```typescript
// After challenge creation (to be added):
if (targetUserId) {
  await notificationService.notifyChallengeReceived(
    targetUserId,
    challengerId,
    challengerName,
    challengeId,
    description,
    pointsReward,
    gameId
  );
}
```

## üöÄ Features Ready for Integration

The following are **ready to implement** but need connection:

### 1. Send Notification on Challenge Creation
**Where:** `GameSidebar.tsx` after `createChallenge` success

**Code to add:**
```typescript
if (targetUserId && challengeResult.success) {
  await notificationService.notifyChallengeReceived(
    targetUserId,
    account.id,
    account.profile?.username || 'Anonymous',
    challengeResult.id,
    newChallengeDesc.trim(),
    newChallengeReward,
    gameId
  );
}
```

### 2. Filter Challenges by Target User
**Where:** `GameSidebar.tsx` in challenges list

**Logic to add:**
```typescript
// Only show challenges that:
// 1. Are open to everyone (no targetUserId)
// 2. OR are targeted to current user
const relevantChallenges = challenges.filter(
  c => !c.targetUserId || c.targetUserId === account.id
);
```

### 3. Accept Challenge Validation
**Where:** `GameSidebar.tsx` in `handleAcceptChallenge`

**Logic to add:**
```typescript
// Check if challenge is targeted to someone else
if (challenge.targetUserId && challenge.targetUserId !== account.id) {
  addToast({
    type: 'error',
    title: 'Cannot Accept',
    message: 'This challenge is for someone else',
    duration: 3000,
  });
  return;
}
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Search Performance**: Client-side filtering after fetching. Consider server-side filtering for scale.

2. **Multiple @mentions**: Currently supports one target user. Could expand to multiple mentions for group challenges.

3. **@ in middle of text**: Dropdown only appears for the last @ in the string. Could improve to handle multiple positions.

4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Dropdown doesn't support arrow keys to navigate results. Could add for better UX.

5. **Offline Search**: Requires network request. Could cache recent/popular users for offline search.

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Short Term
1. **Keyboard navigation** for mention dropdown (‚Üë/‚Üì arrows, Enter to select)
2. **Recent mentions** - Show recently challenged users at top
3. **Validation message** when trying to challenge yourself
4. **Character count** indicator for description (X/100)

### Medium Term
1. **User avatars** in mention dropdown
2. **User stats** hover tooltip (win rate, challenges completed)
3. **Group challenges** - Tag multiple users with @
4. **Suggested users** - Show friends or rivals first

### Long Term
1. **@ mentions in chat** - Extend to chat messages
2. **Mention notifications** - Notify when mentioned anywhere
3. **Mention analytics** - Track who mentions you most
4. **Autocomplete** - Predictive text based on your history
